                                                                    Recent technical advancements, including information, communication and sensing technologies, connected and/or autonomous vehicles, vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity are a few of the driving factors in transforming today’s transportation systems. The big data that is both generated and required by these emerging technologies has further inspired the development and application of novel analysis approaches, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based computing, for modeling, prediction and data-driven decision making in transportation networks. Finally, new perspectives in transportation, including shared mobility, mobility-as-a-service and multimodal systems form another driving force in shaping the future transportation networks.

                                                <b>Abstract:</b> Recent years, wireless communication, onboard computation facilities (personal digital assistants, smartphones, etc.), and advanced sensor techniques
                                                (loop detector, camera, GPS-based vehicle probe, etc.) have enabled a well-connected and data-rich transportation system, i.e., connected vehicle system (CVS). Even though the CVS has been granted a great potential to smartly route
                                                travelers (or CVs) to avoid traffic congestion, scholars have recognized that as the majority vehicles become CVs, current real-time information provision and routing methods may worsen traffic congestion, given each CV still selfishly and
                                                independently chooses its own shortest path (independent routing). This inherent deficiency of the current routing methods is rooted in the inconsistency between system performance (system-optimality) and individual vehicles' route choice behavior (user-optimality).
                                                By viewing this, our studies have introduced a novel Coordinated In-Vehicle Routing Mechanism (CRM), which coordinates the routing decisions of a group of CVs en route to address the overreaction phenomenon and the inability to control system performance. While the CRM is shown to outperform independent routing methods with respect to system performance, it is not designed to ensure a specific
                                                level of system performance. To boost the performance of the CRM, we further investigate information perturbation strategies for the CRM. It is an information provision scheme that strategically alters the traffic information sent to CVs opting in the CRM to mitigate network congestion. Our studies proved that the system performance improvement thanks to the information perturbation is more significant than the corresponding average user optimality loss.

It is more likely to happen when introducing a novel mobility system that the public is not familiar with. Therefore, this proposed methodology adapts the Knowledge gradient, one of the optimal learning policies, to sequentially expand a transit route system. The algorithm evaluates alternative links to which a route can extend based on prior knowledge about the reward, demand coverage. It examines deterministic reward and knowledge gradient, which represents the value of exploring a link. Two examples are provided: grid network with artificial demand data and simplified graph of Public Use Microdata Areas in New York City with household travel survey.

However, a majority of studies assume AVs are essentially human drivers but react faster, “see” farther, and “know” the road environment better. We believe AVs’ most disruptive characteristic lies in its intelligent goal-seeking and adapting behavior. Building on this understanding, we propose a dynamic game-based control leveraging the notion of mean-field games (MFG). I will first introduce how MFG can be applied to the decision-making process of a large number of AVs. To illustrate the potential advantage that AVs may bring to stabilize traffic, I will then introduce a multi-class game where AVs are modeled as intelligent game-players and HVs are modeled using a classical non-equilibrium traffic flow model. Last but not the least, I will talk about how the MFG-based control is generalized to road networks, in which the optimal controls of both velocity and route choice need to be solved for AVs, by resorting to nonlinear complementarity problems.

                                                <b>Abstract: </b> Ride-hailing services have brought significant mobility benefits to travelers; however, they have also increased vehicle miles traveled (VMT), congestion, and vehicle emissions. Shared-ride or ride-splitting services are seen by some as having the potential to provide similar mobility benefits to travelers with significantly lower VMT, congestion, and emissions levels. Unfortunately, shared-ride service options still represent a small share of all vehicle-based shared mobility trips in most cities. While the reasons for this are manifold, undoubtedly operational inefficiencies play an important role.
                                                The shared-ride mobility service operational problem has traditionally been modeled as a combined dynamic traveler-vehicle assignment and routing (i.e., sequencing of pickups and drop-offs) problem, wherein vehicles are assumed to take the shortest path between each pair of pickup/drop-off locations. In our study, we explicitly incorporate path-finding into the operational problem and consider both travel time and proximity to future demands on paths. This non-myopic approach implicitly incorporates future information about the system into the control function.
                                                The presentation will discuss the underlying operational problem, modeling approach, computational results, implications for mobility service providers and transportation planners/policymakers, and future research directions. The computational results compare the proposed path-finding approach with the conventional shortest path approach in terms of user wait times and in-vehicle travel times along with fleet VMT and fleet utilization.

                                                <b>Abstract: </b>This paper presents a matching mechanism for assigning drivers to routes where the drivers pay a toll for the marginal delay they impose on other drivers. The simple matching mechanism is derived from the deterministic algorithm for online bipartite matching. The toll, which is anticipatory in design, is an adaption of one proposed by Dong et al. Our research proves that the matching mechanism proposed here is Pareto user-optimal, that is, it is fair to all drivers and achieves a competitive ratio of 1 + log(m), where m is the number of available routes, when applied with a goal of minimizing total network travel cost.

In stochastic dynamic networks with dependencies, past and current network state information can be used to adjust the knowledge of future network states, which may lead to changes in corresponding optimal routing solutions. This study considers the problem of optimal reliable routing in stochastic dynamic networks, adaptive to en-route in-vehicle information or information from a connected vehicle (CV) environment. An approach is presented for proactive and reactive routing solutions with access to en-route in vehicle and CV information, respectively. Approximations targeted at improving computational efficiency for large-scale implementations of the approaches are also presented.

                                                <b>Abstract: </b> Max-pressure traffic signal control has many desirable properties. It is analytically proven to maximize network throughput if demand could be served by any signal control. Despite its network-level stability properties, the control itself is decentralized and therefore easily computed by individual intersection controllers. Discussions with city engineers have suggested that a major barrier to implementation in practice is the non-cyclical phase actuation of max-pressure control, which can actuate any phase, in arbitrary order, to serve the queue(s) with highest pressure. This arbitrary phase selection may be confusing to travelers expecting a signal cycle and is therefore unacceptable to some city traffic engineers. This paper revises the original max-pressure control to include a signal cycle constraint. The max-pressure control must actuate an exogenous set of phases in order, with each phase actuated at least one time step per cycle. Each cycle has a maximum length, but the length can be reduced if desired. Within those constraints, we define a modified max-pressure control and prove its maximum stability property. The revised max-pressure control takes the form of a model predictive control with a one cycle lookahead, but we prove that the optimal solution can be easily found by enumerating over phases. The policy is still decentralized. Numerical results show that as expected, the cyclical max-pressure control performs slightly worse than the original max-pressure control due to the additional constraints, but with the advantage of greater palatability for implementation in practice.

Motivated by recent successes achieving system-level congestion elimination on small, idealized traffic settings using deep reinforcement learning, this talk addresses two major remaining obstacles: scaling to a diverse array of traffic scenarios, and near-term concerns around the robustness and trust of automated vehicles. To overcome these challenges, the work studies: 1) the potential of transfer learning for generalizing knowledge across diverse traffic scenarios, and 2) the potential for human drivers to emulate learned congestion-mitigating control laws. These results have implications for sustainability and the near-term impact of mixed fleets.
